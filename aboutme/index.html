    <p> Hi guys sorry for my late response, I'm from Venezuela but I currently living in Atlanta Georgia
         with my wife and our newborn daughter Olivia.</p>
    <p> I work as a CMM Programmer and I have the opportunity
         to inspect and program all kind of parts from the aerospace field to simple stuffs as a surface plate.</p>

    <p>In my spare time I like to run and I'm currently training for my first marathon this year. 
            I am pursuing a bachelor degree isn Applied Technology and hopefully this year I will finish my 
            second certificate. </p> 
       <p>I hope all you guys succeed this semester.</p>  
         <p>All the Best</p>
